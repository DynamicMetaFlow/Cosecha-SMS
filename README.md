Feel free to browse the commit history to see my process. Most of the process I used was from [this awesome tutorial](https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Redux-Boilerplate). I also used various other tutorials/boilerplates.

## Dev Setup

A couple of things you need to have installed on your machine:
- Node
- Git
- Webpack

Go to your working directory on the terminal. Then clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/celsom3/Cosecha-SMS.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```
cd Cosecha-SMS
```

Install the NPM packages:

```
npm install
```

Initialize Webpack:

```
npm run dev
```

Run the development server:

```
npm run start
```

You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:3000` on your browser and see the app.
